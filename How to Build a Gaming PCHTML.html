<title>How to Build a Gaming PC</title>

<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>    Before I say anything, the wannabes who just want a gaming pc to fit in with their friends,
ASK YOURSELF do you really want a gaming pc? Or do you just want to fit in. If you just play vid-
eo games and don't give two shits about hardware or anything, you can leave. This is made for peo-
ple who work for their goals, not just scroll to the bottom and buy something. If you're still in-
terested, you definitely stick around. If you have any specific questions, you can email me at topgunaditya@gmail.com</p>
